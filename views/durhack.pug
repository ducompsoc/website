            h2 DurHack is CompSoc's Flagship Annual Hackathon
            p CompSoc runs a large-scale annual hackathon with students from all sorts of universities from all over the country. At DurHack 2017, we had students come from as far as Croatia!
            p Planning is well underway for another hackathon in late 2018 â€“ <a class="typeform-share link" href="https://ducompsoc.typeform.com/to/bMrpxS" data-mode="drawer_right" target="_blank">sign up to our mailing list</a> <script> (function() { var qs,js,q,s,d=document, gi=d.getElementById, ce=d.createElement, gt=d.getElementsByTagName, id="typef_orm_share", b="https://embed.typeform.com/"; if(!gi.call(d,id)){ js=ce.call(d,"script"); js.id=id; js.src=b+"embed.js"; q=gt.call(d,"script")[0]; q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q) } })() </script> to be amongst the first to hear about it!

            h5 28th-29th January 2017
            p DurHack first ran in January 2017, CompSoc's first ever 24-hour hackathon sponsored by big names like Durham County Council, GitHub, MLH, Sunderland Software City, Durham Students' Union, Entrepreneurs Durham, Waterstons, Barclays, Microsoft and Durham University. With enormous data sets from in and around Durham, participants from various UK universities utilised it to produce something that can potentially make a different to the region. 24 hours of coding interspersed with workshops, games, VR, short sleep sprints and awesome food, the event was a massive success.
