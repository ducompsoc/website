                            p Durham University had its first ever 24-hour Hackathon sponsored by big names like Durham County Council, Github, MLH, Sunderland Software City, Durham Students Union, Entrepreneurs Durham, Waterstons, Barclays, Microsoft and Durham University. With enormous data from in and around Durham, participants from various UK Universities utilized it to produce something that can potentially make a differemce to the region. 24 hours of coding interspersed with workshops, games, VR, short sleep sprints and awesome food, the event was a massive success.

                            p Joe Nash from Paypal talked to the students on March 2, 2016 about what hackathons are, how they are often misunderstood as attempts to break into systems, and how they are a brilliant opportunity to network with people from all parts of the world, develop new skills and an opportunity to land in a job as well! That's how Joe ended up working at PayPal. The students also got introduced to NodeJS.
