                        p Joe Nash, working at Paypal talked to the students on March 2, 2016 about what hackathons are, how they are often misunderstood as attempts to break into systems, and how they are a brilliant opportunity to network with people from all parts of the world, develop new skills and an opportunity to land in a job as well! That's how Joe ended up working at PayPal. The students also got introduced to NodeJS.
