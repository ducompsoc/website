								DurHack first ran in January 2017, CompSoc's first ever 24-hour hackathon sponsored by big names like Durham County Council, GitHub, MLH, Sunderland Software City, Durham Students' Union, Entrepreneurs Durham, Waterstons, Barclays, Microsoft and Durham University.
							</p>

							<p>
								With enormous data sets from in and around Durham, participants from various UK universities utilised it to produce something that can potentially make a different to the region. 24 hours of coding interspersed with workshops, games, VR, short sleep sprints and awesome food, the event was a massive success.
